abstract: "A theoretical framework proposing a universal non-linear reaction-diffusion equation that describes the dynamics of effective quantum degrees of freedom across multiple scales. The theory offers a unified approach to diverse phenomena ranging from cosmological scales (dark energy, dark matter) to quantum systems and biological rhythms. The central equation formalizes the observed empirical dispersion suppression rule and provides a mathematical foundation for emergent phenomena across physics."
