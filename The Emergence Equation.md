\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a fundamental equation describing the dynamics of effective quantum degrees of freedom, from which spacetime and material properties emerge. Building upon an empirically observed dispersion suppression law, we propose a universal partial differential equation that potentially unifies phenomena across vastly different physical scales, from quantum coherence to cosmic expansion.

\section{Motivation and Starting Point: From Empirical Function Laws to Universal Equations}

Historically, breakthrough advances in physics have begun with simple "functional laws" discovered from extensive observational data:
\begin{itemize}
\item From \textbf{Kepler's laws} ($T^2 \propto R^3$) to \textbf{Newton's law of universal gravitation} ($\mathbf{F} = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$).
\item From \textbf{Hooke's law} ($F = -kx$) to the \textbf{harmonic oscillator equation} ($\ddot{x} + \omega^2 x = 0$).
\item From \textbf{Planck's quantization law} ($E = \hbar\omega$) to the \textbf{Schr√∂dinger equation} ($i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi = \hat{H}\psi$).
\end{itemize}

The motivation of this research is to repeat a similar pattern at the frontier of modern physics. Our starting point is the \textbf{"dispersion suppression law"} observed across surprisingly broad scales, from temporal rhythms in biological systems to galaxy stability and cosmological scales:

$$\mathrm{Var} \propto \frac{1}{N_q}$$

Here, $N_q$ represents the effective number of quantum degrees of freedom that are simultaneously correlated within a system. This empirical law is consistent with \textbf{Fisher information} in quantum estimation theory ($\mathrm{Var}[\hat\theta] \ge \frac{1}{N_q I(\theta)}$), suggesting that this is not merely a coincidental relationship. However, this is merely a "functional law" describing the static state of a system. Behind it, there must be a \textbf{unified mathematical structure} governing the interaction of dynamic degrees of freedom and their temporal evolution. The purpose of this research is to elevate this functional law to a universal \textbf{partial differential equation}.

\section{The Emergence Equation (Draft)}

Based on the motivation above, we propose a fundamental equation describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of effective degrees of freedom:

$$\frac{\partial^2 n}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 n + \frac{\pi}{e} \, n \left(1 - \frac{n}{n_c}\right)$$

This nonlinear reaction-diffusion type equation describes the behavior of the \textbf{"effective degree of freedom density" $n(\mathbf{x}, t)$} in a system.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{First term:} $c^2 \nabla^2 n$ represents the spatial \textbf{diffusion (wave propagation)} of information correlation. Here, $c$ is the \textbf{maximum speed} at which correlations can propagate, corresponding to physical constraints such as the speed of light in the universe.
\item \textbf{Second term:} $\frac{\pi}{e} \, n \left(1 - \frac{n}{n_c}\right)$ represents \textbf{self-regulatory nonlinear interactions} between effective degrees of freedom. This is a logistic-type growth and saturation term, indicating the dynamic balance of the system.
\end{itemize}

The fundamental constants inherent in this equation encode the essential physics of the system:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\pi$ and $e$ provide universal standards for \textbf{geometric structure} and \textbf{statistical scaling}, respectively.
\item The stable solution $n_c$ of this equation suggests the \textbf{saturation density} of the system, i.e., the maximum value that the effective degrees of freedom can attain. This is interpreted as being established by a "non-resonant guarantee" in an integrated model of matter, spacetime, and information.
\end{itemize}

\section{Value and Prospects of the Equation}

This emergence equation brings significant value to physics in the following ways:

\subsection{Unified Description}

The solutions to this equation have the potential to provide a unified description of phenomena across entirely different physical scales:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cosmological scale:} Explaining the accelerated expansion of the universe and the behavior of \textbf{dark energy} through the dynamic behavior of $N_q$, potentially resolving tensions in cosmology.
\item \textbf{Galactic scale:} Describing galactic rotation curves and \textbf{dark matter} phenomena as stable solutions (measure evolution) of spatial degree of freedom density.
\item \textbf{Quantum scale:} Describing the dynamics of \textbf{coherence} and \textbf{decoherence} in quantum systems such as superconducting qubits and ion traps.
\item \textbf{Biological systems:} Explaining \textbf{emergent temporal rhythms} such as molecular motors and circadian rhythms in living organisms as patterns of self-organization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Historical Continuity}

This research follows the successful pattern of physics: "functional law $\to$ universal equation $\to$ new cosmic perspective." It is an attempt to mathematically formalize the insight of 21st-century physics that spacetime and matter are not ultimate entities but \textbf{emergent consequences} of a more fundamental existence: "effective quantum degrees of freedom."

\subsection{Falsifiability}

The proposed equation is not merely a conceptual framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Terrestrial experiments:} Direct measurement of the temporal evolution of effective degree of freedom density $n(t)$ using ion traps or superconducting circuits to verify the equation's predictions.
\item \textbf{Cosmology:} Verification of the evolution of $N_q(t)$ in cosmic evolution as an \textbf{inverse problem} using precise cosmological data such as CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, and structure growth.
\end{itemize}

If this equation is correct, it means revealing the "dynamics of existence itself" behind the dispersion law. This equation will be a solid step toward the next grand unified picture of physics: the \textbf{integration of matter, spacetime, information, and life}.
